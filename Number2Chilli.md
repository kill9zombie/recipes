\#2 Chilli
=========

Serves about 4 people. It takes about 30 mins to prep, then about 8 hours in the slow cooker.

It reheats well, I tend to give it about 5 mins in the microwave and add some grated cheese.
Don't worry about the liver.  It almost turns into a gravy, it just makes the chilli really rich.
Plus, liver's meant to be good for you.  Read Mary Roach's book Gulp :)

Ingredients
-----------

* pinch of salt
* 2 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 tsp coriander seeds
* 2 (or 3) smoked chipotle

* 2 cloves smoked garlic
* 3 small onions
* 1 red pepper
* 1 scotch bonnet

* 2 tsp ground smoked paprika
* 1 400g can chopped tomatoes
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp tomato puree

* 300g ox liver
* 300g beef mince

* Ilkley Brewery "[The Mayan](http://www.ilkleybrewery.co.uk/our-beers/item/the-mayan-bottle)" chocolate chipotle stout

Requirements
------------

* Slow cooker.
  I use a 3.5 Litre slow cooker.

* Frying pan
  Just a small pan (20cm is fine) to roast the spices.

* Pestle and mortar
  .. to grind said spices.

Spices
------

Add a pinch of salt to the pestle and mortar.  Then put the smoked chipotles, 2tsp cumin and 2tsp coriander seeds in a dry frying pan.

Heat the frying pan with the spices until they smell nice, make sure you don't burn them.
Once they're done, add them to the pestle and mortar and grind them finely.

Chopping
--------

Chop the onions, garlic and pepper, put them in the slow cooker crock once chopped.
Finely chop the scotch bonnet and add it to the crock.

Finely chop the liver and add it to the crock.

More stuff for the crock
------------------------

Add the following to the crock:

* 2 tbsp flour
* The can of tomatoes
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp of soy sauce
* 2 tbsp tomato puree
* The beef mince

Then add the spices from the pestle and mortar.

Give it a good stir, then add stout until the chilli's just about covered.

Cooking
-------

Set the slow cooker on low and leave for 8 hours.

Now once you've done the washing up (I'd wash the knife and board you used for the liver at the very least) you're free to go out galavanting and search for a good IPA to go with the chilli :)
